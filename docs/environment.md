Follow the steps to make the environment:

## [Build the environment](Build_the_environment.md)

Once cluster is up, the next step is to bootstrap the cluster:

## [Launch the cluster](Launch_the_cluster.md)

Artificial load will be sent to the cluster. That is achieved with Sysbench:

## [Sysbench](Sysbench.md)

And finally, monitoring will be done using Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM):

## [PMM (optional)](PMM.md)
